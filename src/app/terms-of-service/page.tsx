              <p>
                The scope of all services will be precisely defined in a formal Statement of Work (SOW) or a separate contractual agreement.

              <p>
                Upon receiving full and final payment for a Project, all Intellectual Property Rights for any custom software, code, and other deliverables created specifically for the Client will be transferred to you, unless otherwise stated in the SOW. Cauders retains the right to use its pre-existing tools, libraries, and frameworks that are not unique to your Project.
